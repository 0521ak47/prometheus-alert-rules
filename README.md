# Shared Prometheus Alert Rules

​	The goal of this repository is collect prometheus alert rules for everyone to use. We all want good alerting. But writing new rules for common things shouldn't be something everyone has to do from scratch. This is a place for people to share useful alerts they have written, and a place for people to find good alerts without having to re-invent the wheel every time. If anything this can serve as a great resource of examples for people to create their own rules. 	

​	If you would like to contribute your own rules please submit a Pull Request. I welcome changes to existing rules and new ones equally. If there is not already a file for what you would like to add feel free to add it. 

## Using these alerts

​	These are user submitted alerts. Be mindful of the job names and intervals. You may have named your jobs differently or wish to use different percentages or time intervals. Also be aware of severity levels. You may have different types of notifications tied to different severity levels. Make changes accordingly when needed. ​This project is largely meant as a copy / paste resource. However, do so responsibly.
